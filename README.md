# CSI_Blood_Splatter_Detection
Blood splatter analysis software for integrated development with DJI Robomaster EP. Uses OpenCV and computer vision in order to analyze blood stains and categorize them to operatives on scene in grouping of likely causes. This tool assists CSI operatives automatically without the help of on-site operators.

PS. Robotics Classmates check out robomaster_camera.py for intialization code (and/or robomaster_test.py).
